                    <h3>Soup</h3>
                    <p>It might not look like it, but this soup’s base isn’t made with dairy. Instead, it gets its creamy texture from blended white beans, cashews, and savory miso paste.</p>

                    <h3>Slaw Salad</h3>
                    <p>Slaws are some of the best make-ahead salad recipes out there. Typically made with hearty vegetables like cabbage, kale,or broccoli, they’re sturdy enough to be dressed ahead of time. I like to accent the veggie base with a punchy dressing, herbs, and even fruit for maximum flavor.</p>
